THe folder contains my senior captsone project in machine learning that focuses on predicting a person's personality using spending habits.
Each of the folders contain a diffent part of the project includeing code, code output, the project paper, and presentations.
The first folder Code_Data_v1.05 contains the data used to train the machine learning models, python code, and python code outputs.
The folder Final_Pres_v1.05 contains files for the latex file used to genrate the PDF presentation and the final presentation PDF.
The folder noted Paper_v1.20 contains files for latex and the resulting PDF research paper for the project that outlines the entire project and prelimanry research.
The last folder Pre_Pres_v1.06 was a latex files for a presntation that was presentated at the half-way point of the project.
The conclusion from the project is that spending habits can be accuratly used to determine a person's personality, and accuracy can eb increase by altering the machine learning alogrithm.
